- Status: Proposed
- Deciders: Thomas H.
- Date: 2025-08-20

## Abstract

This RFC proposes to use GitButler for committing work in this repository.

## Dependencies

This RFC depends on the successful implementation of [RFC 0001: Move from main to main](0001-move-from-master-to-main.md).

## Motivation

GitButler is a tool that helps developers create small, logical commits. This will improve the quality of our commit history and make it easier to review code and track changes.

## Plan

1.  All contributors will be encouraged to use GitButler for their work.
2.  A link to the GitButler documentation will be added to the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file.

## Notes

- Update Gemini rules to reflect the new workflow.
