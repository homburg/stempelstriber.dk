## Abstract

This RFC proposes to document the automated workflows triggered by GitHub events in this repository.

## Motivation

Having clear documentation of the automated workflows will make it easier for contributors to understand the CI/CD process and troubleshoot any issues. It will also serve as a reference for future improvements to the workflows.

## Plan

1.  Identify all the GitHub event triggers in the repository (e.g., push, pull_request).
2.  For each trigger, document the sequence of jobs and steps that are executed.
3.  The documentation will be added to a new file `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
