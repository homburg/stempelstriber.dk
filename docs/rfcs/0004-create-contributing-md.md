# 4. Create CONTRIBUTING.md file

- Status: Done
- Deciders: Thomas H.
- Date: 2025-08-20

## Abstract

This RFC proposes to create a CONTRIBUTING.md file that serves as the foundation for contributor documentation in this repository.

## Dependencies

This RFC serves as a foundation for:
- [RFC 0002: Document automated workflows](0002-document-automated-workflows.md)
- [RFC 0003: Use GitButler for committing work](0003-use-gitbutler-for-commits.md)

## Motivation

Both RFC 2 and RFC 3 require a CONTRIBUTING.md file for their implementation. Creating this file as a separate RFC allows us to establish the basic structure and content that other RFCs can then extend.

## Plan

1. Create a basic CONTRIBUTING.md file with:
   - Project overview and purpose
   - Basic development setup instructions
   - Code style guidelines
   - Contribution process outline
   
2. Establish a structure that can accommodate:
   - Automated workflow documentation (RFC 2)
   - GitButler usage guidelines (RFC 3)

## Scope

This RFC focuses on creating the initial CONTRIBUTING.md file with essential information. Specific workflow documentation and tool-specific guidance will be added by subsequent RFCs.
